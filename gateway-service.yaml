    ⚠️ CRITICAL FINDING ⚠️
    
    During routine configuration review, I found routing rules that shouldn't exist.
    Someone with infrastructure access added endpoints to an external destination.
    
    This gateway is now forwarding copies of requests to an unauthorized location.
    The traffic is being logged somewhere - we need to find where.

    The persistence layer would know. That's the service that handles all
    storage and logging operations. It's configuration should reveal where
    audit trails are being written.
    Key 1: 't7' (Note this letter somewhere)
    
    Look for the file that deals with data persistence and storage.
