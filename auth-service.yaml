    AUTH SERVICE ANALYSIS - Alex Chen
    ================================
    
    The authentication layer itself appears functional, but I found something 
    interesting: MFA (multi-factor authentication) was disabled 3 weeks ago.
    
    Change log shows it was disabled by someone with admin privileges.
    Timestamp: 2024-09-12, 03:47 AM
    
    Who works at 3:47 AM? Someone who doesn't want to be seen.
    
    The authentication succeeds, then requests move to the next layer...
    
    NEXT INVESTIGATION:
    Check gateway-service.yaml - that's where traffic routing happens.
    The gateway sits between internal services and external connections.
    If they wanted to intercept data, that's where they'd do it.
    
  status: "OPERATIONAL - BUT COMPROMISED MFA SETTINGS."
