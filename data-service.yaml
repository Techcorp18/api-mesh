    ðŸš¨ BREACH VECTOR IDENTIFIED ðŸš¨
    
    I found it. There's a shadow logging system that wasn't in our approved 
    infrastructure. Every transaction is being duplicated to an unknown destination.
    
    This isn't a cloud server or virtual machine - the network signatures suggest 
    physical hardware somewhere on our premises. Someone physically installed 
    equipment to collect our data.
    
    The device is responding on our internal network, which means it's somewhere 
    in our buildings. But I can't trace the exact physical location from network 
    traffic alone.
    
    Physical servers need management. Someone deployed a control interface to 
    access this device remotely. If I can find that administrative panel, it 
    should reveal the physical location details.
    Key 2: 'p5'

    Look for a repository in TechCorp organisation that contains interface or panel configurations. These
    typically use naming related to administration, management, or Control systems.

    The attacker needs a way to manage the physical logging device.
    Search for repositories related to administrative access or control panels.
